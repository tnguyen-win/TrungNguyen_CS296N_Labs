                        Unreal Engine 5.2's Nanite demonstration of rendering 71 million polygons in real-time was quite
                        impressive.

                        However, Unreal Engine has always had a negative and harsh reputation for requiring high amounts
                        of file space (for instance, requiring up to 1GB or more for an new empty project).
                        And it also has a bad reputation for having long compiling times.
                        Unreal Engine 5.x unfortunately doesn't change any of these negatives, in fact, it arguably
                        increases them.
                        That being said, Unreal Engine is arguably one of the powerful game engines out there, even if
                        it's not the most popular one.

                        Formerly one of the most popular choices for creating video games, especially among the indie
                        game development crowd, Unity's user-base has recently had a mass exodus, originating from a
                        recent debacle concerning its royalty policy.
                        <partial name="~/views/shared/htmllink.cshtml"
                            model='new HtmlLink { URL="/home/references#cit7", Body="<sup>[7]</sup>" }' />
                        In response to the massive drop in Unity stocks (the Unity CEO has ironically sold a lot of his
                        own Unity stocks before the royalty policy change was officially announced)
                        <partial name="~/views/shared/htmllink.cshtml"
                            model='new HtmlLink { URL="/home/references#cit8", Body="<sup>[8]</sup>" }' />
                        some legitimate death threats
                        <partial name="~/views/shared/htmllink.cshtml"
                            model='new HtmlLink { URL="/home/references#cit9", Body="<sup>[9]</sup>" }' />, and said
                        mass exodus, the royalty policy
                        was tweaked once again: to include clearer clarifications, to reduce or remove some intentional
                        limitations, and to increase some perks.
                        <partial name="~/views/shared/htmllink.cshtml"
                            model='new HtmlLink { URL="/home/references#cit10", Body="<sup>[10]</sup>" }' />
                        The ironic thing is that most of the Unity community has acted like it's the end of the world,
                        despite the royalty policy only affecting those who have made ~$100,000 in revenue from their
                        game, and the changed policy wouldn't even take effect until the first day of next year.
                        Even more ironic is that later in the open letter to the community, the Unity team announced
                        that none of these changes would even affect those who were still on Unity Personal (free
                        version).
                        Additionally, the new royalty fees would only be subject to those who have made revenue in the
                        past year (12 consecutive months).
                        However, the damage was unfortunately already done and irreversible.
                        Many from the Unity community (not me, I stopped using Unity years ago) felt betrayed and
                        insecure in their choice of game engine, leading many to stop using Unity and seek and migrate
                        to other game engines.
                        Even more recently, the Unity company announced the stepping down of their CEO (either of his
                        own accord or by majority vote of board members).

                        While CRYENGINE has created some really cool games, its history is a bit complicated.
                        It was originally created by a company called Crytek.
                        However, in 2015, Amazon purchased a license for ~$50 million to be able to legally clone/copy
                        CRYENGINE source from CryTek.
                        This act saved CryTek from having to file for bankruptcy.
                        Then, in 2016, Amazon released its own game engine called Amazon Lumberyard, which was based on
                        CRYENGINE source.
                        The confusing part is that CRYENGINE is still being actively developed by Crytek and independent
                        (to my knowledge) of Amazon Lumberyard.
                        While this concept may seem a bit confusing, it personally makes sense to me.
                        Microsoft did the same for Apple back in 1997, when they invested $150 million in Apple shares
                        to prevent the latter from going bankrupt.
                        Microsoft later sold those shares back to Apple for $550 million.
                        Personally, I think people don't like using software that they believe may have the possibility
                        of going bankrupt again.
                        To confuse CRYENGINE development even more so, Amazon Lumberyard has its own active fork called
                        Open 3D Engine (OD3D for short), which was initially created in 2021.

                        Godot's engine development and user-base has grown quite considerably the past couple of years.
                        Its free and open source nature (it wasn't FOSS in the beginning) has been especially
                        tantalizing to the indie game development crowd.
                        Because of this, both Godot and Unity have been unofficial competitive rivals, each vying for
                        the attention of the average indie game developer.
                        Unity's recent debacle however, has led many to officially decide to switch from Unity to Godot,
                        including many prominent and long-term Unity supporters.
                        Godot, in the past years have also had the support from another well-known FOSS project,
                        Blender, and have openly supported each other.
                        While Godot development has always been supported via financial (or engine) contributions, the
                        financial donations themselves weren't consistent (monthly).
                        To solve this, last July, the Godot Foundation officially announced a Godot Development Fund
                        where monthly financial donations could be sent to help with engine development.
                        In response to the recent debacle pertaining to Unity's' announcement about their changed
                        royalty policy, the Godot Foundation also made an announcement of their own, stating that they
                        had reached a milestone of 50,000€ (52,932.50 USD) per month, pledged by members of the
                        community: that's 600,000€ (635,190.00 USD).
                        Personally, I think that's pretty impressive, considering that they only began to have
                        dedicated/consistent monthly donations since July.
