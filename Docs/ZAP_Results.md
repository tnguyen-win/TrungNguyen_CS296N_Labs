# Comments

* Tested all three scan types while logged-in as an authorized, but not admin, Identity user. In this case, the user `Jane`, which's automatically generated by my SeedData.

* The two warnings mentioned at the bottom relating to `unsafe-inline` can be resolved by adding `Content-Security-Policy` header responses, if I remember correctly from when I was testing solutions. However, my TailwindCSS stuff fails then, because it uses dynamic CSS + JS to do what it's meant to - but that's the whole point of the security risk too. If I used static generated CSS / JS, for instance TailwindCSS NPM instead of TailwindCSS CDN, then maybe that would resolve the problem, not sure. The various online research I did was rather vague on whether TailwindCSS NPM resolves these issues or not.

> The issues you chose to mitigate and the classes and methods that you changed to implement the mitigation.

- 🟠 Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
  - **Mitigation:**
	  - Added `form-action 'self` header response for `Content-Security-Policy` in `Program.cs`.
	  - Migrated embedded style tags in `_Layout.cshtml` to an external, but local: CSS file.
	  - Migrated embedded script tags in `_Layout.cshtml` to an external, but local: JS file.

- 🟠 Cross-Domain Misconfiguration
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Downloaded Google Fonts from the remote CDN I was using and stored and used those files locally.

- 🟠 Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
  - **Mitigation:**
	  - Added `DENY` header response for `X-Frame-Options` in `Program.cs` - as was demonstrated during class.
	  - Don't use Google Chrome - it uses remote analytics.
